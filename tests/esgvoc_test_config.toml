# esgvoc Test Configuration for esgprep tests
#
# This configuration is used by pytest to create an isolated test environment.
# It should match your development environment configuration to ensure
# tests use the same vocabulary branches you're working with.
#
# The fixture will:
# 1. Load this configuration
# 2. Create an isolated "esgprep_cv_test" configuration
# 3. Run tests with this configuration
# 4. Restore your original configuration after tests
