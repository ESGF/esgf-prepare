        The Data Reference Syntax (DRS) defines the way the data of a given project have to follow on your filesystem. 
        This allows a proper publication on the ESGF. "esgdrs" has been designed to help ESGF datanode managers to 
        prepare incoming data for publication, placing files in the DRS directory structure, and manage multiple 
        versions of publication-level datasets to minimise disk usage. Only MIP-compliant netCDF files are supported
